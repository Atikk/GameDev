StoryLine.

Prelude-
Year4020
Cane was elected..

In a panic we elected the first person willing to say he could fix everything.
The Chairman of n-Rok..
After the war no one knew what to do, our towns and cities became completely isolated.
The world isn't like it used to be. Before the chaos, the people worked together in harmony.
N-Rok hack their hand in everything. They'd say they "wanted to protect us," but while
Cane and his goons were in charge, the sectors below N-Rok were impoverished.
We were being lied to and no one could do anything about it.

Harbor of Kor-

Enter Sona.

Hench-man #1: //Radio//"We have the girl in Custody"

Com:// Radio//"Copy.. Move her to Sector-3"

Hench-man #2: //Raido//"Come on Red Let get out of here."
"The Drogg are starting to multiply."

//Battle//SeaDrog//

Henchmen fall.

//Scene I - The Inn-Keeper Saul.

Pan-To-Inn:

Inn-Keeper:"You've been sleeping for a week"
"we found you off the shore, not to far from the Harbor."
"Poor child. We saw you being held by members of N-Rok"

Man-1: "We need to report her, or they're going to fine us for incompliance."

Inn-Keeper:"Quiet, can't you see shes been through enough."

Man-1:"Don't you understand what our town is going through, we have enough trouble as it is"
"we need to rid ourselves of these trivial matters and focus on the wellbeing of our village."

Inn-Keeper:"Calm down, she just needs her rest is all"
"Leave her be, She'll be on her way soon enough"

*Knock* *Knock*

Man-1: "It's the nobles!" "Quick hide the girl"

Inn-Keeper:"Quick child this way, come with me."

Enter Swain.

Swain: *Laugh* "We've had reports of a very special young lady that has gone missing in your Village"
"Would your Inn-keeper happen to know of her where abouts by chance?"

Man-1: "No"

Swain: "AH.. Well would you be so kind as to bring the inn-keeper to me?"

Man-1: ** leaves to get Saul **

Enter Saul: "..."

Swain: "Hello there friend. The members of N-Rok and I are here on business"
"We've lost someone very valuable to us, and we mean to retrieve her"

Saul: "I do not know of whom you are looking for"
"This village is not looking for trouble."

Swain: "Good to hear. then you wouldn't oppose us searching through your Inn perhaps"

Saul: "Go ahead, you'll find nothing here."

Swain: "Very well, my men will be quick"
"this is all just routine"

Swain: "As expected, your inn-keeper is a modest man."
"We we will take our leave. Thank you, for your co-operation"

Exit: Swain

Man-1: "I don't like the look of this"
"they wouldn't have sent Swain if the situation wasn't big"
"For God sakes, he's one of Cain's well known generals"
"We need to get rid of her now, Saul"

Saul: "Alright.. Fetch Cole, well have him escort the girl to Garen"
"Hopefully. He'll know what to do."

//End Scene.

//Scene II - Underneath The-INN 

Cole: "Saul, you know I have my rounds. The Drogg are getting worse. What do you need?"

Saul: "N-Rok is searching for this young lady here, we need you to bring her to Garen."

Cole: "To Garen?! I haven't spoken to him since the war."
"Last I heard he was leading the resistance"

Saul: "Exactly, he might just be this girls only chance at escaping N-Rok"
"Cole, she needs your help"
"They have even sent Swain to come find her."

Cole: "But that means..."
"Alright. I understand, I'll take her to Garen."
"But you owe me a big meal when I get back."

Saul: "Leave the village through the tunnels so N-Rok doesn't find you,"
"It will lead you to Sector-5 just off the harbor."
"There's a small boat there you can take north."

Cole: "Hello, my lady, my name is Cole. What is your name?"

Sona:"... Sona."

Cole: "Well then looks like we have ourselves a journey ahead of us"
"Let's be on our way then?"

Saul: "Wait. Take this, he hands Cole a Quil and a Pendant."
"She was carrying these when we found her."
"Be safe."

"Their will is bringing ruin to my people"

Zues: "Young human, proceed upon your journey with caution"
"What you speak of is beyond our control"
"We have influence over your people,"

As a company we have our intended goals.
For these goals we must do what we have to in order to achieve them.

--Valdez tells them a story, of the fall of Jing.--

Valdez: Are you here for the Grand Ball?
N-Rok hosts it every year, celebrating Daeladus.
Would you like to hear the story of the Grand Noble Jing?

If yes: 
Cinematic.

Well once there was a noble who couldnt master magic
He would work day after day trying to practice but would never have any luck
Then one day in a fit of rage the noble decides to leave his home and steal magic from the gods
The magic was strong and the nobel goes home with out feeling bad for what he's done.
The next day after showing his friends his magic, the Nobel does the same thing all over again.
He takes more magic from the gods and then goes home feeling happy for the days work.
After some time, the Noble is visited by the Arch-Nobles asking if he had known where the magic had gone to.
The Noble tells them no.
The Noble then goes out the same night and steals again.
After he gets home, the Noble sees his strength and power he's gained and he is content with all of it
Later that night he has a nightmare about how he has done wrong to the Gods.
He wakes up looks himself in a reflection ashamed for what hes done.. and runs to the ocean.
Splat!
Heh. Did I scare you?
Mothers tell this story to their kids.. before they kill them!
I think Jing wakes up the next day thinking it was only a dream, and continues to steal magic.
Never realizing that he had actually died over the cliff.
Or maybe the Arch-Nobles killed him ???...

As Tifa and Cole try to leave, Swain appears.

Sona is in the middle of the room.  Trapped behind an electrical cage.

Cole: Cain! let her go!!

Garen: To hell with N-rok release her!

Cain:...

Cole tries to get past the fence and is forced back.

Sona is unable to move

Cain: As you wish..
Valdez if you could please release the muse.

Valdez walks to the cage and turns off its power.

Sona is free.

Cain: If you understand the story of the nobels. 
Than I am also inclined to explain to you, that jing's story, is perpetual.
We find things we like, and we do the things we have to in order to get them.
As you are here for the Girl.
N-rok and I have worked to reach this point on our own accord.

Valdez picks up Sona, and begins to walk her to the group.

Lights flash.

Cain: ...

Cain binds everyone in the room in a electrical field.

Valdez: Brother!!

Cain: Im sorry Valdez, we've been planning this for a long time.

Lights flash.

Cain: Start the back up generators, the summon is almost complete.

The super computers start and manifest a black hole in the middle of the room.

Lights flash.

Cain: Now for the life of the nobel I exchange this muse and my brother...

Lights flash.

The muse and valdez cry in agony.
*Aghhh*

The group is forced to watch.

They dissapate into a field of energy and are consumed by the black hole.

Lights flash.

The hole gets bigger and everything turns black.

Slow music starts, and nothing is in the room but a man.

Man:Its been along time, since ive seen Humans.
I've been here for a long time.

Behind the man appears the arch nobles.

Man: They casted me into an eternal slumber.
and they left me in chains forever trapped by my own imagination.

Behind the man is himself battling against the Arch nobels.

*Crack* *Crack*

The chains around his arms crumble and break.

Man: and to the who has set me free, I grant you one wish.

Cain: "It is said that you are the only Nobel who can ressurect Roh.
That is what I ask of you."

Man: Hahaha. You mean you freed me, to bring back the man who imprisoned me here?!
Hahaha.

Man: Alright, I guess a rematch would not be too inconcieveable.

Man: Haha, Mass destruction should do the trick..

*Cain and Jing vanish*

Garen: Cain, you idiot..

The group returns to the facility.
