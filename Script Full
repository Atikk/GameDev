Story line.

Prelude -

Year 4020

Cane was elected..

In a panic we elected the first person willing to say he could fix everything.

The chairman of n-RoK..

After the war no one knew what to do, Our towns and cities became completely isolated.
The world isn't like it used to be. Before the chaos, the people worked together in harmony. 
N-rok had their hand in every-thing, they'd say they "wanted to protect us,
"but while Cane and his goons were in charge, the sectors below N-Rok were impoverished.
We were being lied to and no one could do anything about it.

Man-1: "We need to report her, or they're going to fine us for incompliance."

Inn-Keeper:"Quiet, can't you see shes been through enough."

Man-1:"Don't you understand what our town is going through, we have enough trouble as it is"
"we need to rid ourselves of these trivial matters and focus on the wellbeing of our village."

"We've lost someone very valuable to us, and we mean to retrieve her"

Saul: "I do not know of whom you are looking for"
"This village is not looking for trouble."

Swain: "Good to hear. then you wouldn't oppose us searching through your Inn perhaps"

Saul: "Go ahead, you'll find nothing here."

Swain: "Very well, my men will be quick"
"this is all just routine"

Swain: "As expected, your inn-keeper is a modest man."
"We we will take our leave. Thank you, for your co-operation"

Exit: Swain

Man-1: "I don't like the look of this"

"Cole, she needs your help"
"They have even sent Swain to come find her."

Cole: "But that means..."
"Alright. I understand, I'll take her to Garen."
"But you owe me a big meal when I get back."

"It will lead you to Sector-5 just off the harbor."
"There's a small boat there you can take north."
