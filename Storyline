Story line.Prelude -
Year 4020
Cain was elected..In a panic we elected the first person willing to say he could fix everything.
The chairman of n-RoK..
After the war no one knew what to do, Our towns and cities became completely isolated.The world isn't like it used to be. Before the chaos, the people worked together in harmony. N-rok had their hand in every-thing, they'd say they "wanted to protect us,"but while Cain and his goons were in charge,the sectors below N-Rok were impovrished.
We were being lied to and no one could do anything about it.
